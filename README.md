# Pitch-Detection-and-Synthesis
This program detects pitches in .mp3 files, reproduces them in MIDI, synthesizes them using custom wave formats, and reproduces them though both audio and video.

Project: Melody Extraction and Real Time Signal Processing

Devs: Roberto Noel & Robert Prast

Our project can be logically separated into two major sections, with one being our real time signal processing paired with python visualization and our other section focusing on melody extraction and custom synthesis of the extracted beat. The visualization portion focuses primarily on Music Understanding and Music Information Retrieval, while our custom synthesis and melody extraction has both music information retrieval and music creation elements. In the end, our project is intended to extract a melody from a mp3 file, then perform custom actions on this information, and on our custom playback you can visualize the audio signal wave and frequency analysis.
